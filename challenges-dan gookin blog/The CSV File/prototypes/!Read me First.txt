**There is source code and header file**
	Good practice to have structs and functions as preprocessor directive
	
***Why 1S Format***
	Named it this way because didn't understand the reading of csv files fully 
	so made the prototype (miniDataS.txt) for abstract use.
	miniDataS 4 data entries of the weather_Data.csv with commas replaced with spaces(abstract).

**There are comments in the code for future reference**
1S1 has the first solution.
1S2 improved version of 1S2. 
1S3 lessons learned has the aspects that 1 learned and  the final product
I concluded to.
